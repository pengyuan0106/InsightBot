# Abstract
Enterprise IT support systems handle massive volumes of service tickets that are often multi-aspect, ambiguous, and repetitive. Existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks fail to exploit such ticket data effectively, leading to redundant work and inconsistent responses. InsightBot is a knowledge-driven conversational agent designed for autonomic IT system support through knowledge creation and user intention understanding. The system integrates a two-stage architecture: an offline knowledge creation stage that extracts concepts from historical tickets to construct a graph model for structured knowledge representation, and an online troubleshooting stage that performs concept-guided retrieval and multi-turn clarification dialogues. The retrieved insights are grounded into LLM based agents to generate accurate, context-aware solutions. This demo showcases how InsightBot transforms unstructured tickets into actionable knowledge, understands user intentions interactively, and autonomously resolves IT issues while supporting expert escalation. InsightBot significantly enhances efficiency, consistency, and adaptability in enterprise IT support. It has been deployed in NEC IT service to handle tickets from massive customers.
